I have used **Node JS and Express Js and MongoDb** to implement the problem.

### Installation 
-Install Node of version greater than 6.0.
-Trace to backend folder using cd backend.
-**Run npm install** to Install necessary dependencies. 
-**Run node server.js or nodeman server.js** to run the server.

#####Note
**The Data base file is to be placed in backend/public/files** It will be seeded to the Mongoose Schema once you start the server.
